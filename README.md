## Overview

Welcome to the **qwen3.java** repository! This project provides a Java port of the original C implementation of Qwen3. It is designed for efficient inference in large language models (LLMs). With a focus on performance and usability, this library allows developers to integrate advanced inference capabilities into their Java applications seamlessly.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency in inference tasks.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs for quick implementation in Java applications.
- **Support for Quantization**: Efficient memory usage through Q8 quantization.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples for easy setup and usage.
- **Active Community**: Join discussions, report issues, and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with **qwen3.java**, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Ceejayflames1011/qwen3.java/releases). Look for the appropriate file, download it, and execute it in your Java environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven (for building the project)
- A suitable IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ceejayflames1011/qwen3.java.git
   cd qwen3.java
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Include the library in your project:

   Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>qwen3</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use **qwen3.java** for inference:

```java
import com.example.qwen3.QwenModel;

public class InferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        QwenModel model = new QwenModel("path/to/model");
        String input = "Hello, how are you?";
        String output = model.infer(input);
        System.out.println("Inference Output: " + output);
    }
}
```
